Here’s a breakdown of **inconsistencies, clarity issues, and copy mistakes** in the full draft you shared for your visa proof service. I’ve grouped everything into **Sections** for easier fixing:

---

### 🧠 1. **Positioning Inconsistencies**

* The product is introduced as both `$500` and `$299` **without clear explanation** of tiers upfront.
* It says **"Get Started – \$500"** near the top, but later offers a **Starter plan at \$299** and a **Pro plan at \$500** — confusing naming and placement.

**Fix:** Introduce pricing tiers *after* product explanation. Use clearer names like:

* Starter – \$299
* Pro – \$500
* Concierge – \$999
  And put **“Get Started – from \$299”** at the top to prevent confusion.

### 🔥 2. **Tone Mismatch**

* “Use it to apply for O-1 / EB-1 like a goddamn founder” feels **off-tone for a legal-adjacent product**. Could raise credibility questions.
* “If it shipped, we help you prove it.” is 🔥 but doesn’t match the earlier, more aggressive tone.

**Fix:** Decide on a consistent tone — either **high-trust bold** or **rebellious anti-agency**. Right now, it's bouncing.

---

### 💬 3. **Redundant Phrasing & Copy Bloat**

* Repetition: “Notion visa portfolio” is mentioned *four* times across different sections.
* Redundant: “We get you published — real articles, no fluff” is just a reword of what's said earlier.

**Fix:** Condense into 1–2 killer sentences. E.g.
“We don’t sell PDFs. We organize your real wins — judging, press, LORs — into a lawyer-friendly Notion portfolio.”

---

### 🧩 4. **Missing or Weak Explanations**

* **“Original Contribution”** in the USCIS criteria list is vague — how do you *actually* help with it?
* **“Ghostwriting for LORs”** might sound shady to legal-conscious users. Needs a disclaimer.

**Fix:**

* “Original Contribution” → “We help you frame your unique value in ways USCIS recognizes — using your tech, traction, and awards.”
* “Ghostwriting” → “We help draft letters based on your real work, reviewed by your actual mentors.”

---

### 💸 5. **Pricing Section Mistakes**

* "🟢 Get Started – \$299" is used under both Starter and Pro plans (conflicting).
* Starter = \$299 but early on, \$500 is called "Get Started."

**Fix:** Assign **unique button labels**:

* Starter – \$299 → `Try Starter – $299`
* Pro – \$500 → `Go Pro – $500`
* Concierge – \$999 → `Fast-Track Me – $999`

### 🪪 6. **Visual & Formatting Gaps**

* The pricing table lacks **clear borders or layout** for quick comparison.
* Too many emojis in places where users are skimming for trust markers (👀, 🔍, 🎁, 🧠 repeated frequently).
* Portfolio mockups or UI screenshots are **referenced but not shown**.

**Fix:** Add a clean, 3-column pricing table. Limit emojis to 1 per section title. Show at least **one sample Notion export or PDF visual.**

---

### ✅ 7. **Credibility Gaps**

* “Our awards are earned” is bold — but **what kind of awards? What’s the legitimacy?**
* “Judging invites” mentioned 6–7 times — but **no anchor event names**, e.g. “Maximally Startup Makeathon, Stealth Hack, etc.”

**Fix:**

* Add specific event names, example LOR issuers, sample press links.
* Drop a case study/testimonial earlier in the page — don't hide them under "📸 What You Actually Get"

---

### 📜 8. **Legal Language Overlap**

* “We’re not lawyers” is buried low. Needs to be **above the CTA** for protection.
* “We issue awards — not Fiverr PDFs” — this is a 🔥 line but needs a **clearer contrast** (maybe say “We host real hackathons; winners get public recognition and official certificates”).

**Fix:** Add a bold legal disclaimer link just below pricing:

> “Not legal advice. We help you organize your story — not file the visa.”

---

### 🛠️ 9. **Missing Strategic CTAs**

* No real-time urgency or scarcity ("only 20 Pro spots this month")
* No testimonial-driven CTA after Discord screenshot

**Fix:**

* Add: “⏳ 14 Pro slots left for June” after pricing
* Add social proof: “Join 100+ builders like Sarah and Alex — already O-1 approved”

---

### 🧪 10. **Product Confusion: Is this just Maximally?**

* “We run the events” ← it’s clearly just Maximally rebranded
* The brand name “ExtraordinaryProof” is never visually introduced with a logo or standalone section

**Fix:**

* Add brand hero section like:

```
🧬 ExtraordinaryProof
By the team behind Maximally — India’s fastest-growing hackathon network.
```
