// Goal: Revamp the Extraordinary Club website to clearly explain we're a visa accelerator,
// focused on helping builders get real proof for O-1 / EB-1 applications through judging,
// press, LORs, and community support — all powered by our parent org, Maximally.

// DO NOT change visual theme or add brand-new sections randomly. 
// Focus only on improving the clarity, conversion, and structure of existing blocks.

// Apply the following changes 👇

1. 🔥 HERO SECTION
- Keep headline as: "Prove you're extraordinary."
- Replace subhead with:  
  "Join the visa accelerator for founders, makers, and researchers.  
   Judging invites, press features, LORs — all legit, all done-for-you."
- Button 1: "Get Started Instantly"
- Button 2: "How This Works →"

2. 🛠️ HOW IT WORKS (Change 4-step text):
- Step 1: "🧠 You Fill The Form"  
  → "We audit your profile, understand your work, and match you with the right plan."
- Step 2: "📞 You Book A Call"  
  → "We get on a call to customize your roadmap and assign your first judging slot."
- Step 3: "🛠️ We Build Your Proof"  
  → "LORs, press, judging — all structured inside a lawyer-ready Notion portfolio."
- Step 4: "🚀 You Apply With Confidence"  
  → "Use our proof with your attorney or go solo — either way, you’re credible."

3. 👀 WHO THIS IS FOR — add this sentence at top:
"Built for ambitious builders across tech, research, content, and ops — if you’ve shipped, we’ll prove it."
